# HospSQL
First exposure to JDBC and utilizing it in the Eclipse IDE.  Many ideas for improvement so this is still a fairly early-aged project.
History: Initially I wanted to just get experience with database-esque programming within Java so HospitalMain.java is utilized with a HashMap, which allowed me to create a makeshift database just to tinker around with.  As I felt more comfortable I explored JDBC, Java Database Connection, and how I could make a real database to utilize with my data.  And as I became proficient with that, I created hospsql.java.

Prompt: Rank hospitals within a database based on response times to health emergencies within recovery rooms
as well as consumer ratings.  As well, since database would cover one particular area (for now), can give
average so that can give a general rating and response time expectation for hospitals within a district.
 
Improvement plans:
(1) Option to add districts
(2) Adding ratings for existing hospitals --> calculate new average for rating/response time and update table row
(3) Formatting

No current bugs to report.
