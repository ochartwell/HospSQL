# HospSQL
First exposure to JDBC and utilizing it in the Eclipse IDE.  Many ideas for improvement so this is still a fairly early-aged project.

Prompt: Rank hospitals within a database based on response times to health emergencies within recovery rooms
as well as consumer ratings.  As well, since database would cover one particular area (for now), can give
average so that can give a general rating and response time expectation for hospitals within a district.
 
Improvement plans:
(1) Option to add districts
(2) Adding ratings for existing hospitals --> calculate new average for rating/response time and update table row
(3) Formatting

No current bugs to report.
